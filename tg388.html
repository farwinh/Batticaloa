Ancient map drawn by Egyptian cartographer Ptolemy shows the Eastern Province and Batticaloa as Nagadviba.[ctatb0n} needed] Thus
the people of the Eastern Province were called Nagas. There were several Naga kings and princes who ruled Sri Lanka and Nagadeepa
who were called by various Naga names.These names are listed references in Mahawamsa.

Mannar was the first capital established by Prince Vijaya (the M alla who was expelled by his father from Singapura) around 500 BC. His
son Pandukaabahya moved the capital to Anoora. Ptolemy’s map shows this location as Anoor and it remained with the name for a long time. 
Most probably it was Ana iyoor meaning Elephant-town. Later the capital grew into a city and name was changed into Anuradhapura. 
There were places called Malae meaning Malai or Mountains for the Hill Country.</p>

kingdom of Mukkuva. The name of the villages and towns in Batticaloa still holds the historical evidence of the ancient batticaloan
people. When Mutkuhar intruded through the salty water and reached the destination of their voyage at the forests situated around the lagoon.

was called “Matta-Kallappu” which indicates the destination of Mukkuva’s voyage and the water is flat.</p>

Mukkuva is a coastal community from Ancient Tamil country.[141[15] They are of mixed origin and migrated at various periods in history.
