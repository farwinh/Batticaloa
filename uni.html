<h1>Eastern university</h1>
<h2>The idea of having a Tamil university on the lines of Hebrew University of Israel in the Eastern Province was mooted ¡n 1960 by a
group of professors who were teaching at the University of Ceylon. The project was started by purchasing land near Nilaveli, Trincomalee and was abandoned
later due to lack of funds.The project was started again by K.W. Devanayakam, the former home minister of the UNP government with the collaboration of
Kalpage, Minister of Higher Education during 1981.

The Eastern University, Sri Lanka, was established on 1 October 1986 by a University Order dated 26 September 1986 which was issued under Section 2 of 
the Universities Act No: 16 of 1978 by the Central Government.The university was preceded by the Batticaloa University College established on 1 August
1981. 

.  
established to fill a long-felt need for the development of a higher education institution in the Eastern Province. Its establishment was
recommended by a Committee appointed by the University Grants Commission headed by Professor V. Appapillai, retired professor of
Physics and dean of Science, University of Peradeniya and included Professor RS. Ramakrishna, Professor Y.D.A. Senanayake,
Professor S.T. Fernando, S.H.M.Jameel and Dixon Nilaweera.

K.W.Devanayagam, who at the time was Member of Parliament for Kalkudah electorate and Minister of Justice, took a personal interest in the establishment 
of the Batticaloa University College. It was established ¡n the premises of the Vantharumoolai Madhya Maha Vidyalayam, a school built by the late 
V. Nalliah, Minister for Posts and Telecommunication, Member of Parliament for Kalkudah electorate and Member of the Senate Council for Batticaloa
North. The buildings had been badly damaged by a cyclone of 1978 and were repaired and progressively restructured to suit the purposes of a new University College. 
In addition, over 100 acres of land were added to the original campus. Student hostels and staff quarters have been constructed on this land
and many new buildings are planned. The Batticaloa University College began with two faculties: the Faculty of Science and the
Faculty of Agriculture. These faculties were affiliated to the University of Peradeniya. Professor S. Rajaratnam was appointed as the director of the 
college and he functioned in this capacity until February 1985. K. Rajendra functioned as the first secretary of the college. He was succeeded by R
Sangaravel in June 1983. Professor K.D. Arulpragasam was appointed as Professor S.Rajaratnam as director in April 1985.

Socia list Republic of Sri Lanka (No. 1392/22 of 3 June 2005) under the order made by the section 24 B of the University Act. No 16 of 1978.
The periods between 2003 and 2010 were a time of chaos and confusion ¡n the Eastern University. This period saw factional clashes
between academics wanting to gain the seat of the Vice Chancellor. Having ousted Prof.
Mookiah via careful social engineering of the student body,[cIariñcation needed] Dr. Rabindranath took over initially as the acting Vice
Chancellor and then as the Vice Chancellor(Proper) at the University. Thereafter, a prolonged clash of ideals followed which
resulted in some senior staff being threatened to leave their employment. Eventually, Dr. N.Pathmanathan took over as the vice
chancellor in 2006.

is an Eastern University product, would have succeeded to the chair of the vice-chancellor.Dr. Sutharsan was considered to be the
favorite candidate of the local politicians. However, in February 201 2,[61 Dr. Kiddnan Kobindarajah, who ¡s an alumni of the Eastern
University, was appointed as vice-chancellor on 5 March 2012. Dr Kobindarajah obtained his Ph.D in South Africa and then, due to
political pressure arising from his personal beliefs/activities, he shifted to Canada to escape friction, and eventually became a
naturalized Canadian citizen. Dr. Kobindarajah, amidst a lot of controversies (i.e. allegations of sexual misconduct and factionali smtatb0n needed]) 
completed his term in office as the vice-chancellor on 4 March 2015 and Dr T Jeyasingam took over as the new Vice-Chancellor. In a very difficult time for
the institution — which was struggling to develop after the past decade of compulsive mismanagement — Dr. Jeyasingham operated

somewhat ineffectively as the Vice Chancellor. His leadership has been criticized for actions of favoritism, nepotism and
factionalism. It is noted that Dr. Jeyasingham’s ardent use of official facilities and funds for personal purposes has been
cited by many concerned well-wishers of the university. In January 2019, Professor. F.C.Ragel (a physicist attached to the Faculty of
Science) — officially took over as the new vice chancellor replacing the former incumbent Dr.Jeyasingham. Former vice-chancellors17] of the Eastern
