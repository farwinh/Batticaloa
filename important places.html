<p>Head over to the Batticaloa Lagoon in Sri Lanka, its an appealing tour for those in quest of adventures.

<p>Batticaloa lagoon is popular for its `Singing Fish’. Amid the time of April to September, a clear but faint melodic sound like plucked guitar ascends from the lagoon waters along the Kallady Bridge.
The ambiguous music is ascribed to a noise exuded from some type of marine life discovered in the lagoon. People plunge the end of an oar into the water and hold the opposite end to their ear to tune in to the music clearly.
</p>
<h2>4.Kallady Beach</h2>

<p>Batticaloa is connected by bridge to a long, shoreline fringed peninsula that holds the Kallady neighborhoods. A few territories here have more shade than others. Kallady has an abandoned portion of beach that has ideally saved the tsunami proof all around. Kallady beach is a stunning shoreline on the east bank of Sri Lanka. Decent place to spend your evening in leisure and appreciate the dusk.</p>
<h2>5.Kalkudah and Passikudah</h2>

<p>Situated around 35 km. north of Batticaloa, the two exquisite seas sides of Kalkudah and Passikudah settle on either side of the palm-tipped Kalkudah cliff. The twin bay shorelines, all around shielded from the monsoon by an oceanic reef make up a perfect spot for windsurfing, bathing, water skiing, sailing and so forth.</br>

It is a standout amongst other known reef structures in the eastern bank of Sri Lanka and has also been intended as a Marine Sanctuary by NARA.</p>

<p>Visitors can take a short ride over the countryside on the rented bicycles to reach Unnichchai tank. The route goes towards the lagoon from Batticaloa. The view en-route will be charming with a low forest extended over the lagoon. Unnichchai Tank is a classic area. A huge tank that waters most of the valley. The concrete structure of Unnichchai tank controls the waters of Unnichchai. The concrete work copies the stonework of ancients who planned and built this enormous tank.</p>
