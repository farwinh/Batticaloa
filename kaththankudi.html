<h3>The Kattankudy Mosque Massacre was the killing of over 147 Muslim men and boys on the 3rd of August 1990.[2] Around 30 armed Tamil militants raided four mosques in
Kattankudy where over 300 people were prostrating in Isha prayers. The Sri Lankan Government accuses the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) of committing the
crime.21[3’11 The attack is widely attributed to LTTE, who denied their involvement in the massacre,

Sufism reigned. It was at its best Kaththankudi. Aesthetics were part of the culture and there was a general air of lightness, positivism and cheerfulness.
Women were bustling around the city in beautiful pastel coloured dresses. Lemon green, pink and light blue were the popular colours. 
The elderly women were dressed in simple silk sarees with white background. Nobody wore headdresses. Women worked alongside with their husbands and brothers in
shops. In the afternoon the youth would gather in the compound of the mosques and discuss business, music, education and news around the country.

The businesses were doing well. There were prospects of greater prosperity. Most young men wanted to continue their family businesses.
A few adventurous ones headed for the Middle East. The money they sent helped expand the business of their families.
Everything was going smoothly. The sky was the limit to the happiness to the trading community in the happy go lucky Kaththankudi.
The peace loving Muslims in Kaththankudi were also strong believers in democracy. It was in this township that the first seeds of Sri
Lanka’s main Muslim party, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) were sown on September 11, 1981. A.L. Ahamed was appointed to party chair while M. H. M. Ashraff was elected its founder President.
Though SLMC did not take part in election until 1988 the dialogue on country’s political issues continued. As analysts had pointed out
the birth of the SLMC, which absorbed radical

elements in the community to main stream politics, averted a possible rebellion by Muslim youth later, even in the face of gross crimes against the community by the LTTE.
Two years after the birth of the SLMC a full scale war broke out between the government security forces and the LTTE.The war was fought at the door step of Kaththankudi
between the government forces and the LTTE. However Kaththankudi was not affected in a big way.

<h3>
The political empowerment of Muslims was understandably not to the liking of the LTTE. Besides by then the LTTE started viewing
Muslims with an enemy perception as there were reports that the community was playing the role of informants to government forces.

changed and the massacre of 147 residents in four Kaththankudi mosques on August 3rd became a turning point of Sri Lanka’s conflict.
The Kaththankudi Muslims were awoken to the reality from the utopia that they were living in. They could not afford to be a smug and
self- sufficient community anymore. There was a strong, palpable fear and uncertainty for the first time.

The day before the LTTE massacre in Kaththankudi, some 5,000 kilometres away the United States launched Operation Desert
Shield,which was later known as the first phase of the Gulf War. The war saw the return of thousands of the Middle East employees to
the war battered Kaththankudi with their frustrations over ‘the US harassment of Middle Eastern Muslims’. An ideology which was
based on protectionism and seclusion as opposed to the prevalent open culture of Sufism was propagated with the sole intention
of forming a bulwark against the LTTE.
