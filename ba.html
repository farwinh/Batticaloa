<h3>Main article: Jaffna kingdom With the decline of the Rohana sub-kingdom and the defeat of Polonnaruwa, coming with the rise of Chola power,from about the
13th century CE, these regions became wild. The many irrigation works (tanks etc., which exist even today) became home to malaria(see History of Sri Lanka). 
In the meantime, the eastern coastal region remained less affected by Malaria and began to be occupied. Thus seafaring people who had begun to settle down 
along the coast since the Anuradhapura times, c. 6th Century CE began to flourish. The forests continued to be dominated by the Veddha population which
claimed kingship (“cross-cousins’) with the Sinhala kings of Kandy.


The Batticaloa fort was built by the Portuguese in 1628 and was the first to be captured by the Dutch (18 May 1 638). It is one
of the most picturesque of the small Dutch fort of Sri Lanka, it’s situated in an island, still in good condition.
